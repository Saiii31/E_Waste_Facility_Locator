    <h1>KNOW HOW TO DISPOSE OF OLD KEYBOARDS</h1>
    <p><strong>1. Donate or Sell</strong></p>
    <p>The first option is to donate or sell your old keyboard. If your keyboard is still in good condition, you can donate it to a local school, library, or community center. You can also sell it online through websites like eBay or Craigslist.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Recycle</strong></p>
    <p>If your keyboard is broken or no longer functioning, you can recycle it. Many electronics retailers offer recycling programs for items like keyboards. You can also check with your local waste management facility to see if they have an electronics recycling program.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Repurpose</strong></p>
    <p>Another option is to repurpose your old keyboard. You can turn it into a piece of art or use it as a unique decoration in your home. There are also many tutorials online on how to turn old keyboards into musical instruments or even a clock.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Proper Disposal</strong></p>
    <p>If you cannot donate, sell, recycle, or repurpose your old keyboard, you can dispose of it properly by throwing it away in the trash. However, it is important to note that keyboards contain hazardous materials, such as lead and mercury, that can be harmful to the environment. To minimize the impact on the environment, you should try to dispose of it in the proper way.</p>
    <p><strong>5. Use it for a different device</strong></p>
    <p>If your keyboard is compatible with other devices, such as a tablet or smartphone, you can repurpose it to use with those devices instead.</p>
    <p><strong>6. Find a Recycling Center</strong></p>
    <p>Start by finding a local recycling center that accepts electronics. Many centers will accept keyboards for recycling.</p>

    <h1>WHY YOU SHOULDN'T THROW KEYBOARDS IN THE TRASH</h1>
    <p><strong>Environmental impact</strong></p>
    <p>Landfills are not designed to break down electronic waste, and keyboards can take hundreds of years to decompose.</p>
    <p><strong>Plastic and Carcinogens</strong></p>
    <p>Most computer keyboards are made of plastic, which is not biodegradable. Additionally, computer keyboards are often coated with brominated flame retardants, which are known carcinogens.</p>
    <p><strong>Incineration</strong></p>
    <p>Burning electronic waste releases toxic chemicals into the air, which can harm both human health and the environment. Incineration is not a safe or responsible way to dispose of your old keyboard.</p>
